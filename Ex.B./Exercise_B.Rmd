```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## First Step

Sample 100 values from a log-normal distribution with mu = 1 and sigma = 0.25.

```{r sample_values}
n <- 100
vals <- rlnorm(n, meanlog = 0, sdlog = 0.25)

```


## Second Step

Create a histogram:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
hist(vals, main = paste("Histogram of" ,  "log-normal distributed values"),
     xlab = "values")

```

The mean of these values is:  `r mean(vals)` and the variance: `r var(vals)`.
